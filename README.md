# aesthetic_moodboard_generation

## Image Source: ##


## Model architecture(s): ##
For this project, I will create a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and train it from scratch. Compared to a basic VAE, the CVAE will allow me to generate new images based on a provided label or condition (i.e. mood category ).

## Extra Criteria: ##  
I plan to implement a Gallery GUI that allows users to control the aesthetic of the generated image by giving both a list of mood categories to select from and filtering visual attributes (e.g., warmth, saturation, brightness) with a sliding adjustment feature. The GUI will display a grid of AI-generated images matching the mood and visual attributes, helping users to explore and compare results for creative inspiration or design use.
